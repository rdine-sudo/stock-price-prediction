                <h1>Crypto</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mt-5">After the boom and bust of blockchain in recent years, cryptocurrency has been increasingly 
                    regarded as an investment asset. Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good 
                    predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine 
                    learning for more accurate cryptocurrency price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of 
                    applying different modelling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional 
                    features.  Furthermore, the ever-changing 
                    oscillations suggest a more accurate means of projecting this price is desperately needed. Thus, using 
                    deep learning techniques such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the long short-term memory 
                    (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), which are effective learning models for training data, we must 
                    design a method for the accurate prediction of by considering various factors such as market cap, 
                    maximum supply and, volume, circulating supply. The proposed method is written in Python and 
                    tested on benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed method can be used to make reliable 
                    predictions. Thus, the neural network, which has been used by academics in numerous fields over the 
                    past ten years as one of the intelligent data mining tools
